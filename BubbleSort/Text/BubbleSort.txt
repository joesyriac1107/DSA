Bubble sort has complexity o(n^2)
Bubble sort is table algorithm(which mean two equal objects after sorting will have same relative position with each other before sort)
Bubble sort works with the logic of swapping element to its next element if the element is greater than the next element. 
At end of each iteration element from behind will be in sorted fashion
