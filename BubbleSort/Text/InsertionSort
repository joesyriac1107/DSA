Has complexity same O(n^2)
Here we start sorting the array from the left.
We consider the array from the left initially withone lement is sorted
We then take the first element(next element) of the unsorted array and then comapare it with values of sorted array from right.
If the elements of sorted array is bigger you move the elemnt to its next index.
If the index reaches 0 or if we have a situation where next element of unsorted array is greater than one element of sorted array we insert new Element next to it
