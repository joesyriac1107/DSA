Divide and conquer algorithm
recursive algorithm'
two parts split and merge

Splitting phase
divide arrays into two arrays
and then divide the tow smaller arrays into four smaller arrays
divide untill we have one element

Merging phase
we take two one element array to merge two element sorted array
and two sorted array will merge to four element sorted array
 we merge left and right sibling arrays
 we create temporary enough large to holdall elements in arrays merging
 
 Not inplace alogrithm
 Complexity Nlogn
 stable algorithm
