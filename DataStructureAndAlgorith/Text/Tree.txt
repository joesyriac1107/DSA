Trees:

Hierarichal datstructure
every item in tree is node
Each node can have multiple children but only one parent
RootNode has no parent or first node or top node
only one root node per tree
A leaf node has no children
singelton tree has only one node

cannot have cyclic paths
height -> the longest path or edges from node to leaf 
depth -> number of edges from node to a root node
edge -> parent to child connection or path

all nodes with same depth belong to same level and number of edges of the depth is level number.

So all nodes with depth two will have two edges and is at level 2


Traversal
Level- visit nodes on each level
Pre order-visit the root of every subtree first
Post order-visit the root of every subtree last
In order- visit the left, root and then right child
