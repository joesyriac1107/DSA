Its an improvement of insertion sort
insertion sort had gap interval of 1 for each iteration
shell sort will have larger gap interval, reducing the interval for every iteration
there are many ways of choosing the gap interval
most commonly used is the knuth sequence{(3^k-1)/2}
gap shouldnt be larger than the array size
we choose k such that (3^k-1)/2 is less than array length

we will use array.length/2 as intial gap and then divide gap by 2 in text iteration and so on
