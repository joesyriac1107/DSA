Stack
Abstract Data type
LIFO-Last in First Out
push-adds item as top item of stack
pop-removes top itemof the stack
peek-gets the top item of stack without removing it
ideal backing data structure is linked list

if stacks is backed by linked, then pop peep and push will be constant time complexity O(1)

if its backed by array time complexity is O(n)
